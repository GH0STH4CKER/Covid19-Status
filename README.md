# Covid19-Status

In my project i get data from https://www.hpb.health.gov.lk/en/api-documentation

After getting data i split them into variables after searching for item name. for example "local_total_cases".

I search data for that string and get index of the strings first letter

and select length of characters and get value at rightside of item name

and finally display them .
